**Welcome to Neutra RMS, a latest project of Neutra AI.
**

This webapp is a Record Management System (RMS) which will create & curate different types of records, e.g. 
Invoice, Bill, Payroll, Project, Customer.

I, Ridoan Kabir, is the sole developer behind this project.

It was built on top of PHP & its framework 'Laravel 11' for back-end.

For front end, TailwindCSS framework & Flowbite UI library were used.

For database, I've used MySQL.

For more control, no built-in authentication packages were used. Only hand-written authentication.

Thought this webapp is still in its Alpha version, we are still able to create & curate all kinds of records.
The only objectives left before Beta version is released are to beautify the dashboard & display some graphs.
