## About This Project

Neutra RMS (Record Management System) is a centralized accounting record tracking system. It's a lightweight branch-work from my another solo project, named "VENDORA ERP" which is also under-development.

Here, you can:

- Create **Parties**
- Assign **Projects** on parties
- Create separate **invoice, bill, expense, transfer**, etc. for each project. 
- Receive due amount & overdue bill **alerts**
- Get total accounting **summary**
- Brief **Analytics**
- Dynamic UI **color-change** for varied sections
- **Centralized user management** for limited access & better provacy
- Lightweight **attendance management** for small team (under construction)
- **Auto filter** exployee & employers to attendance (under construction)

## What were used to build this project

- **[Laravel v-12](https://laravel.com/)** : A powerful PHP framework.
- **[Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/)** : A modern UI component library based on Tailwind CSS.
- **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)** : A very popular tabular database system of SQL.
- **[Authentication](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/authentication#authenticating-users)** : Session-based user authentication system  powered by Laravel.
- **[Country Package](https://github.com/nnjeim/world)** : Nnjeim-World package to add all the countries and their currencies, languages, timezones as well as L1, L2, L3 locations (not L4 or city/towns to keep database smaller).
